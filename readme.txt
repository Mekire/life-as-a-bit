Life as a Bit.

This is a cellular automata simulator that I wrote some time ago.  It is written in Python using the Pygame API.  The style is out of dated with my current, but it is quite functional.

Features:
Zooming
Drag mode
Cut and Paste features
A database of life patterns.

For more information on hotkeys and usage, please see my Pygame page:

I hope to recode this up to my standard when I get the chance.
